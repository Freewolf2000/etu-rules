{"name":"Climate","permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{},"content":"<p>The region is well known for hot, humid summers with average temperatures in the 90s. The high humidity interferes with the body’s ability to cool itself through the evaporation of sweat. A measly 95° Fahrenheit with 80% humidity yields a heat index of about 113°. This makes the threat of heat stroke and dehydration a serious factor. Large-scale forays into the wild better involve lugging along copious amounts of water, which in turn greatly increases your odds of becoming fatigued or passing out.</p>\n<p>Winters are relatively mild, with high temperatures in the 60s common through November. Cold fronts usually strike during December, January, and February, with at least a few that produce belowfreezing temperatures. The area occasionally experiences an ice storm that causes downed trees and power lines. Snow is very rare.</p>\n<p>East Texas suffers from huge thunderstorms and tornadoes. Summer months have the possibility of a hurricane or tropical storm hitting the Texas coast and moving inland. These spawn great rainstorms and lead to localized flooding, dangerous winds, lightning, and tornadoes. Typically, folks have plenty of time to prepare for hurricanes but tornadoes strike with very little warning.</p>","_id":"CQ8MkGbMIJSn6uw9"}
{"name":"Flora & Fauna","permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{},"content":"<p>All kinds of critters make East Texas their home. In reality, most wild animals do not pose a great deal of danger. Not many bears live in the area (mostly Louisiana black bears that have been re-introduced into the wild), nor panthers or wolves. The largest carnivore is the alligator, some of which grow quite large at 13 feet long and 600 pounds.</p>\n<p>Rabies outbreaks sometimes cause wild animals to attack, and hikers always face the possibility of encountering a razorback, pack of wild dogs, or being chased by an angry 2,000 lb. bull that strayed off a local ranch.</p>\n<p>However, most people overlook the little things. The greatest animal nuisance are fire ants, which are pervasive. If anyone stands still for very long he will very likely get bitten. Some fields are so dense with fire ants that the mounds are within two or three feet of one another. Their foragers and scouts are everywhere looking for food (or threats) and are not shy about biting or stinging. In a gunfight, staying prone could be very inconvenient in the middle of such a field!</p>\n<p>Heaven forbid someone should faint outdoors in East Texas. Fire ants quickly swarm bodies, and locals can recite tales of an elderly person passing out in a garden and later dying of complications caused by ant bites.</p>\n<p>East Texas is the home of all kinds of snakes, venomous and non-venomous. The most common venomous snakes are water moccasins (also called cotton mouths) and copperheads. Rattlesnakes and the deadly coral snake occasionally make an appearance, but are less common in East Texas.</p>\n<p>Venomous spiders and scorpions strike often from their hiding spots, such as in boots stored in closets. People still die from attacks by the dreaded Africanized or &ldquo;killer&rdquo; bees. Even the billions and billions of mosquitoes and ticks can carry potentially deadly diseases, such as the West Nile virus and Lyme disease.</p>\n<p>As far as plants go, poison ivy, poison sumac, and poison oak are common. While usually not life threatening, they can become a serious health nuisance.</p>\n<p>East Texas is known for its great pine forests, although other hardwood trees are also very common. Pinebox is in the extreme north end of the last remaining North American jungle known as the Big Thicket. This woodland is so dense that locals claim if anyone loses sight of the road he will never find it again.</p>","_id":"I8ZHOQgvgINAcGbp"}
{"name":"History","permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{},"content":"<p>The area around Golan County in East Texas was first settled by various tribes of Native Americans, most numerous being the Caddoans. The Caddoans lived for several centuries in what is today known as Indian Mounds State Park, a popular tourist stop and the site of ongoing archaeological studies by ETU researchers.</p>\n<p>In 1825 Carter Greystone recruited over 150 families to settle around Lake Greystone. Due to a series of floods, the original settlement eventually moved east and became the town of Pinebox in 1855. Carter Greystone’s brother William served as its first mayor until his death in 1875 at the age of 72.</p>\n<p>East Texas Woman’s College was founded in 1888 and became the South East Texas Institute in the early 1900s. Early president Howard O’Brien recommended the Ravens nickname in honor of Texas legend and hero, Sam Houston, who was known as the Raven by the Native Americans. The name was changed to East Texas University in the 1980s.</p>\n<p>Golan County prospered as a farming community, but farming was soon overshadowed by the timber industry. Dozens of small mills once dotted the hills and the industry remains strong to this day.</p>\n<p>In the late 1930s, Lake Greystone underwent a transformation as the Works Progress Administration built a dam, moved the course of Whiskey Creek, and tripled the size of the natural lake.</p>\n<p>In the 1940s the War Department bought up a large swath of the northern part of the county as a wilderness navigation training camp. Budget cuts have been unkind to “Base X” over the decades but it is still staffed today, if barely.</p>\n<p>In 1953 an area of forest east of Pinebox suffered a forest fire, the cause of which was never determined. More than 60 years later, the two square mile section of the forest— known locally as the Burn—remains as blackened and lifeless as the day after the fire.</p>","_id":"ZnidlnJqRQBg3HG1"}

{"name":"East Texas University History","permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{},"content":"<p>The original institution was founded in 1888 as East Texas Woman’s College. However, by 1905, enrollment had dropped from a peak of eighteen students to only five. Fortunately, it was saved from closure by rags-to-riches oil wildcatter Howard O’Brien, whose wife was an ETWC alumnus. Mrs. O’Brien convinced her husband to donate a million dollars to her alma mater, insuring its financial security for years to come.</p>\n<p>Of course, nobody gives away that kind of money without strings attached. Mr. O’Brien insisted that enrollment be opened to men as well as women. That, in turn, meant a name change. The name South East Texas Institute lasted until 1987, following the embarrassing notoriety of being in a magazine list of top party schools. A new president, Paul Patterson, was hired to clean house. As part of his initiative for a clean start, he lobbied the state legislature to change the college’s name to East Texas University.</p>\n<p>Since the late 1990s the university has been run by President James Nelson, a somewhat absentminded, grandfatherly figure loved by the student body.</p>","_id":"RyMtw8iU6fV42Car"}
