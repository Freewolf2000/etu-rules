The caster must have the ability to use the power imbued. He then gathers the required components for both powers and conducts the ritual. The Power Point cost is equal to 5 plus the cost of the power being imbued. Creating an <em>amulet of @Compendium[etu-rules.etu-powers.alP0q7NQqKcNual4]{grant Edge}</em>, for example, costs 8 Power Points.</p>\n<p>When imbuing powers with variable effects, the exact use, which always occurs whenever the talisman is activated, must be determined when the ritual is performed. A talisman with @Compendium[etu-rules.etu-powers.alP0q7NQqKcNual4]{grant edge} always grants the same Edge, one with <em>@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-powers.L4IbjoPtoc58262W]{boost/lower Trait}</em> always boosts or lowers the same Trait, and one firing a 3d6 @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-powers.TbcqRtdavoGl7niL]{bolt}<em>&nbsp;</em>can&rsquo;t fire a single or multiple 2d6 bolts instead.</p>\n<p>During creation of the talisman, it must also be given an activation word, phrase, action, or gesture by the ritualist. This becomes a permanent part of the talisman. Discovering the activation trigger of an unknown talisman must be done through research or trial-and-error.</p>\n<p>Creating a talisman is serious business that takes every bit of a character&rsquo;s will to transfer immense magical power into a physical object. Failure not only destroys the item, but requires drawing on the <strong>@Compendium[etu-rules.etu-setting-rules.Botched Talisman Creation Table]{Botched Talisman Creation Table}&nbsp;</strong>below.</p>\n<p><strong>Use:</strong> The user does not need an Arcane Background or skill to use the device. To activate a talisman, the character must perform the trigger and make a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Traits]{Spirit} roll as if it were his arcane skill roll. The penalty is equal to half the Power Points the power normally requires, rounded down. The <em>@Compendium[etu-rules.etu-powers.alP0q7NQqKcNual4]{grant Edge}</em> power, for example, normally requires 3 Power Points. An <em>amulet of&nbsp;@Compendium[etu-rules.etu-powers.alP0q7NQqKcNual4]{grant Edge}&nbsp;</em>thus requires a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Traits]{Spirit} roll at &ndash;1 (half of the 3 Power Points&nbsp;<em>@Compendium[etu-rules.etu-powers.alP0q7NQqKcNual4]{grant Edge}</em>&nbsp;requires).</p>\n<p>A success or @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Trait Rolls]{raise} works as usual for the power invoked.

If the user rolls a 1 on his @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Traits]{Spirit} die, he suffers 2d6 damage as well.

See @Compendium[etu-rules.etu-bestiary-abilities.zI4NQ0zyvCvwaMnQ]{Bane} on page 76 for creating barriers over which supernatural creatures cannot pass. See the bind entity spell on page 55 for using arcane power to temporarily bind such creatures to the caster&rsquo;s will.</p>\n<h2>Tasks</h2>\n<p>Once a demon is summoned, and assuming it is bound or otherwise disposed to discussion, the summoner must make a bargain with it. This is an opposed test of @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Traits]{Spirits}. Record the results secretly.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Failure: </strong>The demon is uncontrolled and in complete control of its actions. It cannot directly harm the caster but is otherwise free to roam the earth and do as it pleases for 6d6 days. If this roll comes up with three 6&rsquo;s (no more, no less), it remains in the mortal world until slain or banished.</li>\n<li><strong>Success: </strong>The demon basically follows the instructions it&rsquo;s given but looks for every opportunity to ruin things for the cretin who summoned it. Only if directly chastised or supervised does the demon &ldquo;behave.&rdquo;</li>\n<li><strong>@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Trait Rolls]{Raise}: </strong>The demon follows the spirit of the summoner&rsquo;s instructions as well as the letter. It may still cause additional mayhem&mdash;it is a demon, after all&mdash;but in general it performs as the caster desires.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Specialized Demons</h2>\n<p>Some demons might be more inclined to specific requests, especially evil ones. A demon of vengeance, for example, may enjoy exacting vengeance of some sort. This is entirely up to the Dean, the setting, and the description of the creature, but in such a case, the caster gets a +2 bonus to his @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Traits]{Smarts} roll to bargain with the demon when requesting such a task but a &ndash;2 if requesting anything else.</p>\n<h2>Communication</h2>\n<p>Note that demons are not (generally) telepathic. If the summoner plans on sending the demon out of sight, he&rsquo;d best give it very specific instructions. Intelligent demons may be given physical equipment (such as cell phones or transmitters), but whether or not they actually use these tools is entirely up to them.</p>\n</div>","notes":"","additionalStats":{},"equippable":false,"equipped":false,"actions":{"skill":"","skillMod":"","dmgMod":"","additional":{}},"rank":"Veteran","pp":"Special","damage":"","range":"Smarts","duration":"5","trapping":"Pentagrams, black candles, animal sacrifices","arcane":"","skill":"","modifiers":[]},"flags":{"cf":{"id":"temp_kdf4qs8i8ji","path":"Powers","color":"#000040"}},"img":"systems/swade/assets/icons/power.svg","effects":[],"_id":"Jg61VVa0qR0oBTnj"}
