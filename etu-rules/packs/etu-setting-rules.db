Music, live or from the jukebox, resonates throughout the building, and is accompanied by the smell of freshly cooked pizza and various Italian dishes and sauces.</p>\n<p>The Pizza Barn is owned and operated by Morten Decourt, a son of Chicago who now makes his home in Pinebox, Texas. Morten purchased the barn and surrounding land on the west side of Hwy. 96. Here he created a festive restaurant, bar, and dance hall in an effort to combine his two greatest loves&mdash;pizza and the cowboy lifestyle.</p>\n<p>Although two assistant managers share some of the duties, Morty remains handson with his restaurant and can be found therein most nights. He makes a point of greeting customers personally, and although he does not like contemporary music, he hires live bands for every weekend rotation (Thursday-Saturday night).</p>\n<p>The pizza is generally served Chicago style, thick and rich. He keeps most domestic beers on tap, though he discounts local Texas beers. The Pizza Barn has its own house specialty of barbeque pizza, which has developed a loyal following of fans who sometimes drive from all over Texas and Louisiana to eat this delicacy.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The Barn&rdquo; caters to the families of Pinebox and the college crowd, opening at 10 a.m. and closing at midnight, except for Thursday, Friday, and Saturday when it shuts the doors at two in the morning.</p>\n</div>\n</div>","img":"modules/etu-rules/assets/icons/logo-etu.webp","_id":"72i5y82WbvD7XRHF"}

You&rsquo;re about to take your first step into the macabre world of Pinebox, Texas. This particular book, <em>East Texas University</em>, concerns itself with the town&rsquo;s largest enterprise and a hotbed of strange activity&mdash;<em>East Texas University</em>. That&rsquo;s ETU, for short. Here in Texas we like to keep our words short &lsquo;cause we drawl &lsquo;em out anyhow.</p>\n<h2>Some Texas Twists</h2>\n<p>In the world of <em>East Texas University</em>, characters are called students and we call the Game Master the Dean.</p>\n<p>Characters in ETU are full time students. They enroll as Freshmen and must advance through their Sophomore, Junior, and Senior years. Freshman <em>player characters</em> are @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Advancement]{Novice} @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Advancement]{Rank}, Sophomores are @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Advancement]{Seasoned}, Juniors are @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Advancement]{Veteran}, and Seniors are @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Advancement]{Heroic}.</p>\n<p>Students also have a new secondary @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Traits]{Trait} called Scholarship&mdash;see Step 3. This tracks how much attention she&rsquo;s giving her studies versus solving mysteries. Both are equally important at ETU.</p>\n<h2>Step 1: Race</h2>\n<p>All characters are human. If you want to create a student who&rsquo;s part fish, you might try that other university up in Massachusetts. As usual, heroes start with one free @Compendium[etu-rules.etu-setting-rules.Edges]{Edges}.</p>\n<h2>Step 2: Major</h2>\n<p>Students enter college within a primary course of study, or \"Major.\" See the Selected Majors below for some ideas.</p>\n<p><strong>Major Skill:</strong> Students take exams (yes, you will be tested) with the skill most relevant to his Major. This is called his \"Major Skill\" and is usually something like @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.Science]{Science} or @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.Academics]{Academics}. Check out that Selected Majors sidebar below and don&rsquo;t forget to take a Major Skill as one of your starting skills. Students can have an \"Undecided\" Major until their Junior year, rolling Smarts &ndash;1 instead of a Major Skill.</p>\n<p><strong>Minors:</strong> Characters can also have \"Minors\" simply by taking the appropriate skills as they advance but there are no separate rules for them.</p>\n<br />\n<div class=\"graph-half\">\n<h2>Selected Majors</h2>\n<p>Below is a list of common Majors found at ETU, but it is by no means exhaustive. Students are encouraged to discuss other disciplines with their Dean.</p>\n<p>Some Majors require specialization, shown in parentheses after the Major, such as Biology or Chemistry for Science. A History Major, for example, would use @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.Academics]{Academics}, while an entering Mechanical Engineer would have @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.Science]{Science} or @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.Repair]{Repair}.</p>\n<p>Students can further specialize as desired by taking additional skills on their own, but must still take the \"core\" skill for their Major and use it for @Compendium[etu-rules.etu-setting-rules.Exams]{Exams}.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div class=\"swade-columns\">Agriculture<br />Anthropology<br />Archaeology<br />Architecture<br />Art (Music, Painting, Sculpting)<br />Business<br />Computer Science<br />Criminal Justice<br />Cultural Studies<br />Education<br />Engineering (Aerospace, Electrical, Civil, Mechanical, Petroleum)<br />General Studies<br />Kinesiology<br />Military Science (These characters must also be enrolled in R.O.T.C.)<br />Liberal Arts (Creative Writing, English Literature, Fashion, Folklore, History, Journalism, Languages, PreLaw, Psychology)<br />Science (Biology, Biotech, Chemistry, Entomology, Genetics, Geology, PreMed, Pre-Vet, Meteorology)<br />Speech and Communications (Speech, Journalism, Radio/Televisin)</div>\n<div class=\"swade-columns\">&nbsp;</div>\n</div>\n<h2>Step 3: Traits</h2>\n<p><strong>Attributes:</strong> Pick your attributes as described in <em>Savage Worlds</em>. Every character begins with a d4 in every attribute and has 5 points to raise any or all of them to higher die types.</p>\n<p><strong>Skills:</strong> Entering Freshmen are teenagers right out of high school. They have 12 points for skills as usual, but skills shouldn&rsquo;t exceed a d8 without a good background reason. They also start off with 2 additional skill points to spend on @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.fqYNzAjIQz8lKOBj]{Common Knowledge}, @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.Driving]{Driving}, or @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.Research]{Research}</p>\n<p>While college students shouldn&rsquo;t have lots of combat skills, this <em>is </em>Texas and most young men and women have shot a few guns, been in a few fights, or taken a few self-defense classes.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Derived Attributes: </strong>Calculate your secondary attributes&mdash;@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Characters]{Pace}, @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Characters]{Parry}, and @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Characters]{Toughness}&mdash;as usual.</li>\n<li><strong>Scholarship:</strong> Students have a new secondary attribute called Scholarship as well. Scholarship is 0 unless modified by @Compendium[etu-rules.etu-setting-rules.Edges]{Edges}, @Compendium[etu-rules.etu-setting-rules.Hindrances]{Hindrances}, @Compendium[etu-rules.etu-setting-rules.Extracurricular Activites]{Extracurricular Activites}, or circumstance.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Step 4: Edges &amp; Hindrances</h2>\n<p>Choose @Compendium[etu-rules.etu-setting-rules.Edges]{Edges} and @Compendium[etu-rules.etu-setting-rules.Hindrances]{Hindrances} from <em>Savage Worlds</em> or this book as usual.

Maybe that's true. All of France and Britain could fit inside it, after all. Texas has a little bit of everything, from the Piney Woods and Big Thicket of East Texas, across the plains of Central Texas, to the Hill Country, to the deserts and mountains of West Texas. Texans are an eclectic mix of western dreams and northern entrepreneurship. The truth is a West Texan and an East Texan have very different accents, but the following list might help those not used to Texan or Southern lingo.</p>\n<h2>Texas Wisdom</h2>\n<p><strong>Always drink upstream of the herd:</strong> Be different and do your own thing. (The herd fouls the water headed downstream.)</p>\n<p><strong>Better than two peas in a pod:</strong> Very close friends or allies.</p>\n<p><strong>Big hat, no cattle: </strong>All talk, no action</p>\n<p><strong>Don't dig up more snakes than you can kill: </strong>Don't go looking for extra trouble.</p>\n<p><strong>Don't make me open a can of Whoopass!: </strong>I'm about to kick your butt if you don't stop.</p>\n<p><strong>Don't slap a man who's chewing tobacco: </strong>Could get messy.</p>\n<p><strong>Don't squat with spurs on: </strong>Think about the consequences of your actions. If you squat while wearing spurs, you will slice your butt open!</p>\n<p><strong>Dumber than a box of (hammers/rocks): </strong>The boy's extremely dumb.</p>\n<p><strong>Happier than a rooster in a hen house: </strong>A very happy state of mind.</p>\n<p><strong>Having a fit: </strong>Throwing a tantrum.</p>\n<p><strong>He couldn't pour piss out of a boot with directions on the heel: </strong>The boy's dumb!</p>\n<p><strong>He's all swole up: </strong>He's angry, looking to fight.</p>\n<p><strong>He's as sharp as a mashed potato: </strong>The boy's dumb!</p>\n<p><strong>He's on a tear: </strong>He's doing bad things. This is \"tear\" as in \"to tear up paper.\"</p>\n<p><strong>It's a turd floater: </strong>A big rainstorm.</p>\n<p><strong>Letting the cat out is easy, putting him back in the sack is hard: </strong>It's easy to start something, harder to see it through.</p>\n<p><strong>Looks like the cheese fell off the cracker: </strong>Things didn't work out the way it was planned.</p>\n<p><strong>More than you can shake a stick at:</strong> A lot of them.</p>\n<p><strong>Showing his ass: </strong>Being bad, acting badly.</p>\n<p><strong>Sit in the middle and you don't have to open the gate: </strong>Pastures have gates leading in and out. Traditionally, the person sitting shotgun is obligated to open and close them for the driver. Being the middle passenger on a bench seat&mdash;usually the less desirable spot&mdash;excludes you from this obligation.</p>\n<p><strong>That chaps my ass: </strong>Makes me mad.</p>\n<p><strong>That dog won't hunt: </strong>That won't work or doesn't make any sense.</p>\n<p><strong>We've howdied, but we ain't shook: </strong>We know each other, but we haven't come to an agreement, or, we know each other, but we are not friends yet.</p>\n<h2>Texas Wordology</h2>\n<p><strong>Aggervated:</strong> Aggravated. Mild annoyance to crazed rage.</p>\n<p><strong>Ain'noneed: </strong>No reason to.</p>\n<p><strong>Awwready!:</strong> \"All righty.\" Used as an affirmation or agreement.</p>\n<p><strong>Ball:</strong> To play American Football. There is no other sport. Ball is Football in Texas.</p>\n<p><strong>Bloody Nickel: </strong>Slang for Houston's 5th Ward, one of the toughest neighborhoods in the nation.</p>\n<p><strong>Boondocks: </strong>Way out in the middle of nowhere.</p>\n<p><strong>Catching Cold: </strong>Becoming sick or ill.</p>\n<p><strong>Coke: </strong>Any soft drink; not just Coca Cola, but Dr. Pepper, Sprite, Orange Crush, Mountain Dew, etc.</p>\n<p><strong>Dadgummit, dadblammit: </strong>Used instead of curse words.</p>\n<p><strong>Dry County: </strong>A county where it is illegal to sell alcohol.</p>\n<p><strong>Eat Up With: </strong>Excessively afflicted with some bad thing such as jealousy, cancer, or other disease.</p>\n<p><strong>Fixin' to:</strong> About to, or eventually will do something.</p>\n<p><strong>Grocery Store: </strong>Any place that sells food or gas.</p>\n<p><strong>Holler: </strong>To call out.</p>\n<p><strong>Howdy Y'all: </strong>Hello, everyone. Texans give bonus points for double y'alls. \"Y'all want some queso, y'all?\"</p>\n<p><strong>I imagine: </strong>To have intent or belief. \"I imagine it's time to go.\"</p>\n<p><strong>Icebox: </strong>A refrigerator, not necessarily the frozen part, but the entire thing.</p>\n<p><strong>Ice House: </strong>A bar, usually a biker bar.</p>\n<p><strong>Lit off: </strong>To leave in a hurry.</p>\n<p><strong>Nekkid: </strong>A state of being nude.</p>\n<p><strong>Nu-uh: </strong>No way.</p>\n<p><strong>Pissed off: </strong>Angry</p>\n<p><strong>Plumb: </strong>To do something completely.</p>\n<p><strong>Recken: </strong>To think about.</p>\n<p><strong>Sko'eet: </strong>Let's go eat.</p>\n<p><strong>Switch: </strong>A branch or stick used to spank or punish.</p>\n<p><strong>Take on:</strong> To wail or cry.</p>\n<p><strong>Tank: </strong>A pond.</p>\n<p><strong>Tenny Shoes: </strong>Any pair of athletic shoes</p>\n<p><strong>Tejano: </strong>A native Hispanic Texan, pronounced Teh-hah-no or Tay-hah-no.</p>\n<p><strong>Texas Stop Sign: </strong>A Dairy Queen; a fast food restaurant known for hamburgers and ice cream.</p>\n<p><strong>To carry: </strong>To provide a ride.</p>\n<p><strong>What a Do?: </strong>A way to say hello and ask what's going on at the same time.</p>\n<p><strong>Wouldn't Take: </strong>To refuse to sell. \"I wouldn't take less than a thousand for it.\"</p>\n<p><strong>Yankee: </strong>Anyone not born in Texas.

In this day and age, if a person flashes a gun on campus or shoots up the town, the repercussions are quite serious.</p>\n<p>Sooner or later, the heroes are likely to face criminal charges based on what they do in public. For instance, it would be bad to blast away with shotguns at demons in human guise. Even if the bodies or wounded are never found, the heroes could face Aggravated Assault charges if anyone witnesses their actions. In this game, heroes must play smart or they may end up doing hard time!</p>\n<p>Judge Marie Anne Durousseau is a graduate of ETU and only in her mid-30s, having taken over the position after the prior officeholder's disappearance. District Attorney Dennis Holloway is a tough, no-nonsense person who prefers to make deals rather than go to trial. If a case does go to trial, he does everything in his power to see justice served. Although the county doesn't have a full time public defender, when the need arises the job usually goes to local attorney Steven Fuller, a down-on-his-luck alcoholic. Fuller is competent, but those who can afford their own lawyer usually hire James Richardson. Richardson is known for his ability to bargain for deals that keep his defendants out of jail.</p>\n<h3>Criminal Procedure</h3>\n<p>Crimes occurring within the city limits are the jurisdiction of the Pinebox Police Department, otherwise they fall within the county Sheriff Department's jurisdiction. Due to longstanding agreement, the ETU campus is not within Pinebox city limits.</p>\n<p>There's a saying in criminal justice that goes, \"You may beat the rap, but not the ride.\" If a murder takes place&mdash;even in self defense&mdash;the perpetrator will still be arrested and take a \"ride\" in the back of the squad car. It's then up to the justice system to clear her of wrongdoing.</p>\n<p>At the station, she is booked, fingerprinted, and placed into a jail cell until she can be brought before Judge Marie Anne Durousseau for bail to be set. Usually this occurs within 24 hours unless arrested over the weekend, in which case she is seen Monday morning.</p>\n<p>If District Attorney Dennis Holloway believes there is enough evidence to convict, he formally charges the perpetrator with a crime and arranges to present his evidence before the Grand Jury. This frequently occurs months after the crime.</p>\n</div>\n</div>","img":"modules/etu-rules/assets/icons/logo-etu.webp","_id":"INWnZRxkTkjRGIRx"}

Ritual Magic","color":"#000000"}},"content":"<div class=\"swade-core\">\n<div class=\"section-header\">\n<h1>Casting Ritual Magic</h1>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>Activating a power by ritual is a Dramatic Task (see Savage Worlds). No Power Points are used in ritual magic, but the Power Points listed for a particular power are the basis for its difficulty or Casting Modifier. The caster has five rounds to accumulate five successes/raises as usual for a Dramatic Task. Should he fail, the Dean draws a card and consults the Ritual Failure Table (page 51). Success means the spell works. The last roll, the one achieving the fifth success, determines the spell&rsquo;s effect. If opposed, the final roll is the only one the target rolls against.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Mary performs a Ritual. Her first roll gets a raise, for 2 successes. The second roll&rsquo;s final result is an amazing 13, for 3 more successes, and completes the Ritual. The power is opposed, and the target rolls a 7. Mary&rsquo;s Ritual effects the target with a raise.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Rank</h3>\n<p>Ritualists are not restricted by the normal rank requirements for powers, but Deans can use a power&rsquo;s rank as a gauge of a ritual&rsquo;s rarity.</p>\n<h3>Components</h3>\n<p>Rituals require the expenditure of certain items. See Components on page 53.</p>\n<h3>Gathering Power</h3>\n<p>As a Dramatic Task, Rituals take only 30 seconds to execute but significantly longer to prepare. Before beginning, the ritualist prepares components, meditates, chants, and so on requiring ten minutes times the final Casting Modifier (as a positive value). A ritual with a &ndash;3 Casting Modifier would take the lead ritualist 30 minutes to gather her power. The lead caster may perform other actions during preparation, but suffers the &ndash;2 multi-action penalty for doing so. If she&rsquo;s Shaken or wounded during this time she must make a Smarts roll or start over. Rituals with a Casting Modifier of 0 are easy enough to be performed immediately if the components are available. Participants may take actions normally during this period. They suffer no multiaction penalty nor interrupt the preparation time if injured.</p>\n<h3>Casting Modifier</h3>\n<p>The skill used for the Dramatic Task is Ritualism (page 50). The roll penalty is equal to half the power&rsquo;s listed number of Power Points (rounded down). The banish spell, for example, normally requires 3 Power Points, so it has a Casting Modifier of &ndash;1 when using ritual magic.</p>\n<h3>Duration</h3>\n<p>The Duration of spells cast by ritual magic is automatically doubled. They may not be maintained, but for an additional &ndash;2 penalty Duration can be changed to hours. For a &ndash;4 penalty, it&rsquo;s measured in days (if possible&mdash;a bolt is instant and cannot be extended, but boost/lower Trait could.)</p>\n<h3>Range</h3>\n<p>The listed Range of a spell is doubled when cast via Ritual. With a &ndash;4 penalty, the Range is read in miles and ignores usual sight restrictions.</p>\n<h3>Additional Participants</h3>\n<p>Other characters can make cooperative rolls by joining in the ritual.</p>\n<p><strong>Note: </strong>For those familiar with the Rituals presented in the Horror Companion, the ones in ETU have some different modifiers and characters in ETU may not increase damage or effect.</p>\n</div>\n</div>","img":"modules/etu-rules/assets/icons/logo-etu.webp","_id":"O9rbp9SMqcE8747q"}

Unless otherwise noted, the presence of a spirit reduces the ambient temperature in a local area (about the size of a Large Burst Template) by several degrees.

Boasting a city population of over 19,000 and serving a student population of 13,000 more, Pinebox is one of the most important economic centers in East Texas. Located in the heart of what was once the Big Thicket of Golan County, Pinebox serves as a hub of commerce on Highway 96. The highway runs north and south through town.&nbsp; Cane Bottom road runs east all the way to Toleda Bend Reservoir and the Louisiana border, and is one of the most scenic drives in East Texas.&nbsp; West Church Street becomes county road #696 and connects Pinebox to the @Compendium[etu-rules.etu-setting-rules.Lake Greystone]{Lake Greystone} communities to the west.&nbsp; The Tucker Rail line parallels highway 96 and runs to the @Compendium[etu-rules.etu-setting-rules.Base 10 Military Base]{Military Complex} north of the city.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>@Compendium[etu-rules.etu-setting-rules.East Texas University]{East Texas University} provides many jobs and recreational facilities for Pinebox, and it owns buildings in the downtown area for ancillary office space. The Ravens have also partnered with the local school district to offer state-of-the-art recreational baseball, softball, and football fields just north of Church Street.</p>\n<h2>City Government</h2>\n<p>Pinebox is the @Compendium[etu-rules.etu-setting-rules.Golan County]{Golan County} seat, meaning that it is home to the county courthouse as well as city hall. The @Compendium[etu-rules.etu-setting-rules.Police Station and City Jail]{Pinebox Police Department&rsquo;s} jurisdiction ends at the city limits, where it is picked up by the Golan County Sheriff&rsquo;s Department. Through a longstanding zoning agreement, the East Texas University campus is not within the city boundaries Consequently, anything that can&rsquo;t be handled by Campus Security falls under Sheriff Butch Anderson&rsquo;s jurisdiction.</p>\n<h2>Local Businesses</h2>\n<p><strong>Bonner&rsquo;s Bail Bonds:</strong> Because sometimes a night of innocent fun doesn&rsquo;t end up that way.</p>\n<p><strong>Golan County Regional Hospital: </strong>Serves as an emergency center for the town and has many medical and dental offices.</p>\n<p><strong>Horners Used Books or Mary Lynn&rsquo;s Used Books and Emporium:</strong> Both offer a variety of popular fiction and nonfiction, as well as hard-to-find special editions upon request.</p>\n<p><strong>Mom&rsquo;s Diner: </strong>Great stick-toyour ribs home cooking in an oldfashioned diner.</p>\n<p><strong>Pinebox Pawn or 4-Kit-Up Pawn: </strong>Students sometimes need cash quick, making these pawn shops good sources for second-hand equipment.</p>\n<p><strong>Pinebox Fishing and Hunting: </strong>This shop offers a variety of camping, fishing, and hunting supplies, including legal weapons.</p>\n<p><strong>Pizza Barn: </strong>This converted red barn is a student favorite. The pizza is fresh, the beer cold, and the mechanical bull never tires. It even offers a small dance floor and live bands every weekend.</p>\n<p><strong>Sanctuary Comics and Collectibles: </strong>A small comic and game store. Owners Ron and Veronica serve snacks and drinks on Friday and Saturday evenings for the two game rooms in the back.</p>\n<p><strong>Wal-Mart: </strong>Every Southern town has one. A reliable source of clothing, camping supplies, ammo, household goods, and jobs.</p>\n<h2>People of Note</h2>\n<p><strong>Sheriff Butch Anderson: </strong>Local sheriff with a reputation for being extra hard on the college crowd. The Sheriff&rsquo;s Department i s in charge of county matters.</p>\n<p><strong>Mayor James Flowers: </strong>Flowers is a friendly politician who owns a series of body shops and presents himself as a blue collar fellow who made good.</p>\n<p><strong>Reverend Michaels: </strong>Father of the Risen Church of Pinebox. He and his followers are often found on campus and volunteering in various organizations.</p>\n<p><strong>Police Chief Jacob Miner: </strong>A good chief who loves Pinebox and does all he can to make it safe. He&rsquo;s a pretty nice guy until he thinks you&rsquo;re upsetting the peace.

In reality, most wild animals do not pose a great deal of danger. Not many bears live in the area (mostly Louisiana black bears that have been re-introduced into the wild), nor panthers or wolves. The largest carnivore is the alligator, some of which grow quite large at 13 feet long and 600 pounds.</p>\n<p>Rabies outbreaks sometimes cause wild animals to attack, and hikers always face the possibility of encountering a razorback, pack of wild dogs, or being chased by an angry 2,000 lb. bull that strayed off a local ranch.</p>\n<p>However, most people overlook the little things. The greatest animal nuisance are fire ants, which are pervasive. If anyone stands still for very long he will very likely get bitten. Some fields are so dense with fire ants that the mounds are within two or three feet of one another. Their foragers and scouts are everywhere looking for food (or threats) and are not shy about biting or stinging. In a gunfight, staying prone could be very inconvenient in the middle of such a field!</p>\n<p>Heaven forbid someone should faint outdoors in East Texas. Fire ants quickly swarm bodies, and locals can recite tales of an elderly person passing out in a garden and later dying of complications caused by ant bites.</p>\n<p>East Texas is the home of all kinds of snakes, venomous and non-venomous. The most common venomous snakes are water moccasins (also called cotton mouths) and copperheads. Rattlesnakes and the deadly coral snake occasionally make an appearance, but are less common in East Texas.</p>\n<p>Venomous spiders and scorpions strike often from their hiding spots, such as in boots stored in closets. People still die from attacks by the dreaded Africanized or &ldquo;killer&rdquo; bees. Even the billions and billions of mosquitoes and ticks can carry potentially deadly diseases, such as the West Nile virus and Lyme disease.</p>\n<p>As far as plants go, poison ivy, poison sumac, and poison oak are common. While usually not life threatening, they can become a serious health nuisance.</p>\n<p>East Texas is known for its great pine forests, although other hardwood trees are also very common. Pinebox is in the extreme north end of the last remaining North American jungle known as the Big Thicket. This woodland is so dense that locals claim if anyone loses sight of the road he will never find it again.</p>\n</div>\n</div>","img":"modules/etu-rules/assets/icons/logo-etu.webp","_id":"a4sK2qr3bBbJFJ3i"}

However, by 1905, enrollment had dropped from a peak of eighteen students to only five. Fortunately, it was saved from closure by rags-to-riches oil wildcatter Howard O&rsquo;Brien, whose wife was an ETWC alumnus. Mrs. O&rsquo;Brien convinced her husband to donate a million dollars to her alma mater, insuring its financial security for years to come.</p>\n<p>Of course, nobody gives away that kind of money without strings attached. Mr. O&rsquo;Brien insisted that enrollment be opened to men as well as women. That, in turn, meant a name change. The name South East Texas Institute lasted until 1987, following the embarrassing notoriety of being in a magazine list of top party schools. A new president, Paul Patterson, was hired to clean house.

Spirits cause an elevated flux of positive ions due to their electromagnetic discharges. Demonic spirits have the opposite effect and cause negative ions to be more prevalent. The meter adds +1 to @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.ZvwjzMLxsneptV4T]{Notice} rolls to find spirits or demons.</p>\n<p><strong>Barometer, Digital ($120): </strong>This device measures atmospheric pressure and comes with a backlit LED display. Sudden pressure drops or rises can indicate the presence of a ghost, adding +1 to @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.ZvwjzMLxsneptV4T]{Notice} rolls made to detect such spirits.</p>\n<p><strong>EMF (ElectroMagnetic Field) Meter ($80): </strong>This compact and easy-to-use device fits in the palm of the hand and measures electromagnetic fields. The LED light bar scale gives readings from 1.5 to 35 milligaus in small increments. EMF fluctuations signal the presence of ethereal entities, and add +1 to @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.ZvwjzMLxsneptV4T]{Notice} rolls made to detect such entities.</p>\n</div>\n</div>","img":"modules/etu-rules/assets/icons/logo-etu.webp","_id":"zvpYRq4wxtR0rNSn"}
