The high humidity interferes with the body&rsquo;s ability to cool itself through the evaporation of sweat. A measly 95&deg; Fahrenheit with 80% humidity yields a heat index of about 113&deg;. This makes the threat of heat stroke and dehydration a serious factor. Large-scale forays into the wild better involve lugging along copious amounts of water, which in turn greatly increases your odds of becoming fatigued or passing out.</p>\n<p>Winters are relatively mild, with high temperatures in the 60's common through November. Cold fronts usually strike during December, January, and February, with at least a few that produce belowfreezing temperatures. The area occasionally experiences an ice storm that causes downed trees and power lines. Snow is very rare.</p>\n<p>East Texas suffers from huge thunderstorms and tornadoes. Summer months have the possibility of a hurricane or tropical storm hitting the Texas coast and moving inland. These spawn great rainstorms and lead to localized flooding, dangerous winds, lightning, and tornadoes. Typically, folks have plenty of time to prepare for hurricanes but tornadoes strike with very little warning.</p>\n</div>","img":"modules/etu-rules/assets/icons/logo-etu.webp","_id":"SedpRfgEm0BDFYLz"}

Not many bears live in the area (mostly Louisiana black bears that have been re-introduced into the wild), nor panthers or wolves. The largest carnivore is the alligator, some of which grow quite large at 13 feet long and 600 pounds.</p>\n<p>Rabies outbreaks sometimes cause wild animals to attack, and hikers always face the possibility of encountering a razorback, pack of wild dogs, or being chased by an angry 2,000 lb. bull that strayed off a local ranch.</p>\n<p>However, most people overlook the little things. The greatest animal nuisance are fire ants, which are pervasive. If anyone stands still for very long he will very likely get bitten. Some fields are so dense with fire ants that the mounds are within two or three feet of one another. Their foragers and scouts are everywhere looking for food (or threats) and are not shy about biting or stinging. In a gunfight, staying prone could be very inconvenient in the middle of such a field!</p>\n<p>Heaven forbid someone should faint outdoors in East Texas. Fire ants quickly swarm bodies, and locals can recite tales of an elderly person passing out in a garden and later dying of complications caused by ant bites.</p>\n<p>East Texas is the home of all kinds of snakes, venomous and non-venomous. The most common venomous snakes are water moccasins (also called cotton mouths) and copperheads. Rattlesnakes and the deadly coral snake occasionally make an appearance, but are less common in East Texas.</p>\n<p>Venomous spiders and scorpions strike often from their hiding spots, such as in boots stored in closets. People still die from attacks by the dreaded Africanized or &ldquo;killer&rdquo; bees. Even the billions and billions of mosquitoes and ticks can carry potentially deadly diseases, such as the West Nile virus and Lyme disease.</p>\n<p>As far as plants go, poison ivy, poison sumac, and poison oak are common. While usually not life threatening, they can become a serious health nuisance.</p>\n<p>East Texas is known for its great pine forests, although other hardwood trees are also very common. Pinebox is in the extreme north end of the last remaining North American jungle known as the Big Thicket. This woodland is so dense that locals claim if anyone loses sight of the road he will never find it again.</p>\n</div>","img":"modules/etu-rules/assets/icons/logo-etu.webp","_id":"caVEqCuDrChffmDe"}

The Caddoans lived for several centuries in what is today known as Indian Mounds State Park, a popular tourist stop and the site of ongoing archaeological studies by ETU researchers.</p>\n<p>In 1825 Carter Greystone recruited over 150 families to settle around Lake Greystone. Due to a series of floods, the original settlement eventually moved east and became the town of Pinebox in 1855.

Early president Howard O&rsquo;Brien recommended the Ravens nickname in honor of Texas legend and hero, Sam Houston, who was known as the Raven by the Native Americans. The name was changed to East Texas University in the 1980s.</p>\n<p>Golan County prospered as a farming community, but farming was soon overshadowed by the timber industry. Dozens of small mills once dotted the hills and the industry remains strong to this day.</p>\n<p>In the late 1930s, Lake Greystone underwent a transformation as the Works Progress Administration built a dam, moved the course of Whiskey Creek, and tripled the size of the natural lake.</p>\n<p>In the 1940s the War Department bought up a large swath of the northern part of the county as a wilderness navigation training camp. Budget cuts have been unkind to &ldquo;Base X&rdquo; over the decades but it is still staffed today, if barely.</p>\n<p>In 1953 an area of forest east of Pinebox suffered a forest fire, the cause of which was never determined.

Boasting a city population of over 19,000 and serving a student population of 13,000 more, Pinebox is one of the most important economic centers in East Texas. Located in the heart of what was once the Big Thicket of Golan County, Pinebox serves as a hub of commerce on Highway 96.</p>\n<p>East Texas University provides many jobs and recreational facilities for Pinebox, and it owns buildings in the downtown area for ancillary office space. The Ravens have also partnered with the local school district to offer state-of-the-art recreational baseball, softball, and football fields just north of Church Street.</p>\n<h2>City Government</h2>\n<p>Pinebox is the Golan County seat, meaning that it is home to the county courthouse as well as city hall. The Pinebox Police Department&rsquo;s jurisdiction ends at the city limits, where it is picked up by the Golan County Sheriff&rsquo;s Department. Through a longstanding zoning agreement, the East Texas University campus is not within the city boundaries Consequently, anything that can&rsquo;t be handled by Campus Security falls under Sheriff Butch Anderson&rsquo;s jurisdiction.</p>\n<h2>Local Businesses</h2>\n<p><strong>Bonner&rsquo;s Bail Bonds:</strong> Because sometimes a night of innocent fun doesn&rsquo;t end up that way.</p>\n<p><strong>Golan County Regional Hospital: </strong>Serves as an emergency center for the town and has many medical and dental offices.</p>\n<p><strong>Horners Used Books or Mary Lynn&rsquo;s Used Books and Emporium:</strong> Both offer a variety of popular fiction and nonfiction, as well as hard-to-find special editions upon request.</p>\n<p><strong>Mom&rsquo;s Diner: </strong>Great stick-toyour ribs home cooking in an oldfashioned diner.</p>\n<p><strong>Pinebox Pawn or 4-Kit-Up Pawn: </strong>Students sometimes need cash quick, making these pawn shops good sources for second-hand equipment.</p>\n<p><strong>Pinebox Fishing and Hunting: </strong>This shop offers a variety of camping, fishing, and hunting supplies, including legal weapons.</p>\n<p><strong>Pizza Barn: </strong>This converted red barn is a student favorite. The pizza is fresh, the beer cold, and the mechanical bull never tires. It even offers a small dance floor and live bands every weekend.</p>\n<p><strong>Sanctuary Comics and Collectibles: </strong>A small comic and game store. Owners Ron and Veronica serve snacks and drinks on Friday and Saturday evenings for the two game rooms in the back.</p>\n<p><strong>Wal-Mart: </strong>Every Southern town has one.

Ritual Magic","color":"#000000"}},"content":"<p>Activating a power by ritual is a Dramatic Task (see Savage Worlds). No Power Points are used in ritual magic, but the Power Points listed for a particular power are the basis for its difficulty or Casting Modifier. The caster has five rounds to accumulate five successes/raises as usual for a Dramatic Task. Should he fail, the Dean draws a card and consults the Ritual Failure Table (page 51). Success means the spell works. The last roll, the one achieving the fifth success, determines the spell&rsquo;s effect. If opposed, the final roll is the only one the target rolls against.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Mary performs a Ritual. Her first roll gets a raise, for 2 successes. The second roll&rsquo;s final result is an amazing 13, for 3 more successes, and completes the Ritual. The power is opposed, and the target rolls a 7. Mary&rsquo;s Ritual effects the target with a raise.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Rank</h2>\n<p>Ritualists are not restricted by the normal rank requirements for powers, but Deans can use a power&rsquo;s rank as a gauge of a ritual&rsquo;s rarity.</p>\n<h2>Components</h2>\n<p>Rituals require the expenditure of certain items. See Components on page 53.</p>\n<h2>Gathering Power</h2>\n<p>As a Dramatic Task, Rituals take only 30 seconds to execute but significantly longer to prepare. Before beginning, the ritualist prepares components, meditates, chants, and so on requiring ten minutes times the final Casting Modifier (as a positive value). A ritual with a &ndash;3 Casting Modifier would take the lead ritualist 30 minutes to gather her power. The lead caster may perform other actions during preparation, but suffers the &ndash;2 multi-action penalty for doing so. If she&rsquo;s Shaken or wounded during this time she must make a Smarts roll or start over. Rituals with a Casting Modifier of 0 are easy enough to be performed immediately if the components are available. Participants may take actions normally during this period. They suffer no multiaction penalty nor interrupt the preparation time if injured.</p>\n<h2>Casting Modifier</h2>\n<p>The skill used for the Dramatic Task is Ritualism (page 50). The roll penalty is equal to half the power&rsquo;s listed number of Power Points (rounded down). The banish spell, for example, normally requires 3 Power Points, so it has a Casting Modifier of &ndash;1 when using ritual magic.</p>\n<h2>Duration</h2>\n<p>The Duration of spells cast by ritual magic is automatically doubled. They may not be maintained, but for an additional &ndash;2 penalty Duration can be changed to hours. For a &ndash;4 penalty, it&rsquo;s measured in days (if possible&mdash;a bolt is instant and cannot be extended, but boost/lower Trait could.)</p>\n<h2>Range</h2>\n<p>The listed Range of a spell is doubled when cast via Ritual. With a &ndash;4 penalty, the Range is read in miles and ignores usual sight restrictions.</p>\n<h2>Additional Participants</h2>\n<p>Other characters can make cooperative rolls by joining in the ritual.</p>\n<p><strong>Note: </strong>For those familiar with the Rituals presented in the Horror Companion, the ones in ETU have some different modifiers and characters in ETU may not increase damage or effect.</p>","_id":"i2wWxOGjyd8eeGXV"}
