{"name":"Casting Ritual Magic","permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{},"content":"<p>Activating a power by ritual is a Dramatic Task (see Savage Worlds). No Power Points are used in ritual magic, but the Power Points listed for a particular power are the basis for its difficulty or Casting Modifier. The caster has five rounds to accumulate five successes/raises as usual for a Dramatic Task. Should he fail, the Dean draws a card and consults the Ritual Failure Table (page 51). Success means the spell works. The last roll, the one achieving the fifth success, determines the spell&rsquo;s effect. If opposed, the final roll is the only one the target rolls against.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Mary performs a Ritual. Her first roll gets a raise, for 2 successes. The second roll&rsquo;s final result is an amazing 13, for 3 more successes, and completes the Ritual. The power is opposed, and the target rolls a 7. Mary&rsquo;s Ritual effects the target with a raise.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Rank</h2>\n<p>Ritualists are not restricted by the normal rank requirements for powers, but Deans can use a power&rsquo;s rank as a gauge of a ritual&rsquo;s rarity.</p>\n<h2>Components</h2>\n<p>Rituals require the expenditure of certain items. See Components on page 53.</p>\n<h2>Gathering Power</h2>\n<p>As a Dramatic Task, Rituals take only 30 seconds to execute but significantly longer to prepare. Before beginning, the ritualist prepares components, meditates, chants, and so on requiring ten minutes times the final Casting Modifier (as a positive value). A ritual with a &ndash;3 Casting Modifier would take the lead ritualist 30 minutes to gather her power. The lead caster may perform other actions during preparation, but suffers the &ndash;2 multi-action penalty for doing so. If she&rsquo;s Shaken or wounded during this time she must make a Smarts roll or start over. Rituals with a Casting Modifier of 0 are easy enough to be performed immediately if the components are available. Participants may take actions normally during this period. They suffer no multiaction penalty nor interrupt the preparation time if injured.</p>\n<h2>Casting Modifier</h2>\n<p>The skill used for the Dramatic Task is Ritualism (page 50). The roll penalty is equal to half the power&rsquo;s listed number of Power Points (rounded down). The banish spell, for example, normally requires 3 Power Points, so it has a Casting Modifier of &ndash;1 when using ritual magic.</p>\n<h2>Duration</h2>\n<p>The Duration of spells cast by ritual magic is automatically doubled. They may not be maintained, but for an additional &ndash;2 penalty Duration can be changed to hours. For a &ndash;4 penalty, it&rsquo;s measured in days (if possible&mdash;a bolt is instant and cannot be extended, but boost/lower Trait could.)</p>\n<h2>Range</h2>\n<p>The listed Range of a spell is doubled when cast via Ritual. With a &ndash;4 penalty, the Range is read in miles and ignores usual sight restrictions.</p>\n<h2>Additional Participants</h2>\n<p>Other characters can make cooperative rolls by joining in the ritual.</p>\n<p><strong>Note: </strong>For those familiar with the Rituals presented in the Horror Companion, the ones in ETU have some different modifiers and characters in ETU may not increase damage or effect.</p>","_id":"X4WmrilJ5flTaTJZ"}

Silver-plating costs $100 multiplied by the weapon’s damage dice plus any bonus. Silver-plating a sword (Str+d8), for example, costs $800 (8 × $100), while plating the chain for a Black and Decker 18\" chainsaw (2d6+4) runs a cool $1,600 (6 + 6 + 4 = 16 × $100). Silver plating used in this way is 50% likely to flake off after any extended use (a typical combat).</p>\n<p>Silvered Dreams in Pinebox is the most likely place to get this work done (see page 42).</p>\n<table style=\"border-color: #000000; border-style: solid;\" border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"2px\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"background-color: #910609; text-align: center;\">\n<td style=\"width: 630px; color: #ffffff;\" colspan=\"3\"><strong>SILVER WEAPONS AND AMMO</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"background-color: #000000;\">\n<td style=\"color: #ffffff;\"><strong>TYPE</strong></td>\n<td style=\"color: #ffffff;\"><strong>WEIGHT</strong></td>\n<td style=\"color: #ffffff;\"><strong>COST</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"background-color: #dbd1b7;\">\n<td>Shotgun ammo, silver buckshot</td>\n<td>5/25</td>\n<td>$40/1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"background-color: #eeeade;\">\n<td>Shotgun ammo, silver slug</td>\n<td>6/25</td>\n<td>$80/1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"background-color: #dbd1b7;\">\n<td>Pistol ammo, silver</td>\n<td>1/10</td>\n<td>$25/1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"background-color: #eeeade;\">\n<td>Rifle ammo, silver</td>\n<td>1.5/10</td>\n<td>$50/1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"background-color: #dbd1b7;\">\n<td>Silver plated weapon</td>\n<td><span class=\"fontstyle0\">—</span> &nbsp;</td>\n<td>$100 x damage</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"background-color: #eeeade;\">\n<td>Arrow/Quarrels, silver heads</td>\n<td>1/5</td>\n<td>$25/1</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>","_id":"tumPMJhEOeh2bYBw"}
